Absolutely! Let's break down Day 2 into manageable practice exercises:

### Practice Exercise 1: Java Classes and Objects
1. Create a Java class named `Car` with the following attributes:
    - `make` (String)
    - `model` (String)
    - `year` (int)
    - `mileage` (double)

2. Add a constructor to initialize the attributes of the `Car` class.
3. Implement getter and setter methods for all attributes.
4. Create an instance of the `Car` class in the `main` method and print its details.

### Practice Exercise 2: Exception Handling in Java
1. Write a Java method named `divide` that takes two integer parameters `numerator` and `denominator`, and returns the result of dividing `numerator` by `denominator`.
2. Implement exception handling to catch the `ArithmeticException` that may occur if the `denominator` is zero.
3. If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, print an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed, and return a default value such as zero.

### Practice Exercise 3: Collections Framework
1. Create an `ArrayList` named `studentNames` to store the names of students in a class.
2. Add at least five student names to the `studentNames` list.
3. Iterate over the `studentNames` list and print each student's name.
4. Create a `HashMap` named `studentGrades` to store the grades of students (use student names as keys and grades as values).
5. Add grades for the students in the `studentGrades` map.
6. Iterate over the `studentGrades` map and print each student's name along with their grade.

### Practice Exercise 4: Object-Oriented Programming and Exception Handling
1. Create a Java class named `BankAccount` with the following attributes:
    - `accountNumber` (String)
    - `balance` (double)

2. Add a constructor to initialize the attributes of the `BankAccount` class.
3. Implement a method named `withdraw` that takes a double parameter `amount` and simulates withdrawing money from the account.
4. Implement exception handling to catch the `IllegalArgumentException` that may occur if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.
5. If an `IllegalArgumentException` is caught, print an error message indicating insufficient funds, and do not perform the withdrawal.

These exercises should provide a comprehensive review of Java classes and objects, exception handling, and the Collections framework. They cover essential concepts and offer hands-on practice to solidify your understanding. Feel free to modify or extend the exercises as needed!
