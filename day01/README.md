Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of Day 1's practice lesson focusing on Java basics:

### Day 1: Introduction to Java

#### Practice Lesson:
1. **Java Syntax and Basics:**
   - Start by writing a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - Introduce variables and data types:
     - Declare variables of different data types (int, double, String, boolean).
     - Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Implement control structures:
     - Write if-else statements to check conditions.
     - Use loops (for, while) for iteration.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming in Java:**
   - Create a basic class representing an object (e.g., Car, Person) with attributes and methods.
   - Demonstrate the concept of class instantiation by creating objects of the defined class.
   - Explore inheritance:
     - Create a subclass inheriting from a superclass.
     - Override methods in the subclass.
   - Experiment with polymorphism:
     - Create multiple subclasses inheriting from a common superclass.
     - Use method overriding to achieve polymorphic behavior.

3. **Practice Exercises:**
   - Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle using a method.
   - Implement a simple banking system using classes for Account, Customer, and Transaction.
   - Solve programming challenges (e.g., FizzBuzz, Fibonacci series) to practice control structures and basic algorithms.

4. **Resources:**
   - Online tutorials and resources:
     - Oracle's Java Tutorials: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
     - Java Programming Basics on Tutorials Point: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm
   - Recommended readings:
     - "Head First Java" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates.
     - "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch.

5. **Review and Reflection:**
   - Reflect on the concepts learned today.
   - Review the practice exercises and ensure understanding.
   - Take notes on any questions or concepts that need further clarification.
