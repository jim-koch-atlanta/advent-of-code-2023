Absolutely! Let's break down Day 3 into a detailed lesson plan with explanations and practice exercises for each topic:

### Topic 1: Java generics
1. **Understanding generics**:
    - Explanation: Introduce the concept of generics in Java, which enables you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate with parameters that are types instead of concrete values.
    - Example: Demonstrate a generic class such as `Box<T>` that can hold any type of object.

2. **Using generics**:
    - Explanation: Discuss how to use generics to create flexible and type-safe code.
    - Example: Implement a generic method `printArray` that prints elements of any array.

3. **Wildcards and Bounds**:
    - Explanation: Explain wildcard types (`?`) and bounded wildcards (`? extends T`, `? super T`) to specify constraints on the types used with generics.
    - Example: Show how to use bounded wildcards with a method that accepts a list of numbers and finds the maximum value.

4. **Practice Exercises**:
    - Exercise 1: Implement a generic class `Pair<T, U>` to represent a pair of elements of different types.
    - Exercise 2: Write a generic method `swap` that swaps the elements of an array.
    - Exercise 3: Create a method that accepts a list of any type and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.

### Topic 2: File I/O Operations in Java
1. **Reading from Files**:
    - Explanation: Discuss how to read data from text files using Java's `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` classes.
    - Example: Read a text file line by line and print its contents to the console.

2. **Writing to Files**:
    - Explanation: Explain how to write data to text files using Java's `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter` classes.
    - Example: Write text to a file and save it on the disk.

3. **Handling Exceptions**:
    - Explanation: Discuss how to handle exceptions that may occur during file I/O operations.
    - Example: Use try-with-resources statement to automatically close resources after use.

4. **Practice Exercises**:
    - Exercise 1: Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it.
    - Exercise 2: Implement a method to copy the contents of one text file to another.
    - Exercise 3: Create a program that reads a CSV file containing student information and displays it in a formatted table.

### Topic 3: Introduction to Java Streams API
1. **Overview of Streams**:
    - Explanation: Introduce the Java Streams API, which provides a powerful way to handle collections of data in a functional style.
    - Example: Create a stream from a list and perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.

2. **Stream Operations**:
    - Explanation: Discuss common stream operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `collect`, etc., and how they can be used to process data.
    - Example: Demonstrate filtering elements based on a condition and mapping them to a different type.

3. **Parallel Streams**:
    - Explanation: Explain how to use parallel streams to take advantage of multi-core processors for faster data processing.
    - Example: Compare the performance of sequential streams vs. parallel streams for processing a large dataset.

4. **Practice Exercises**:
    - Exercise 1: Write a program that reads a list of integers from a file and finds the sum of all even numbers.
    - Exercise 2: Implement a method to filter out duplicate elements from a list using streams.
    - Exercise 3: Create a program that reads a list of names from a file, converts them to uppercase, and writes them to another file.

### Summary and Wrap-Up
- Review the key concepts covered in Day 3, including generics, file I/O operations, and the Streams API.
- Encourage students to practice and experiment with the concepts learned through coding exercises and real-world scenarios.
- Provide additional resources and references for further learning and exploration.

This detailed lesson plan provides a structured approach to learning Java generics, file I/O operations, and the Streams API, along with hands-on practice exercises to reinforce understanding. Adjust the complexity of exercises based on the students' proficiency level and available time.
